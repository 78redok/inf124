PA 1: Building a Dynamic Website

Our website features:
(1) Hamburger three bar menu - This feature allows for the navigation menu items to disappear into the hamburger icon. When clicking on the icon, the menu items appear in a slide-out style menu.
(2) There are 4 main pages
    A. Home - This page features an introductory greeting.
    B. About Our Company - This page contains detailed information regarding the two students who created the website.
    C. Products - Upon entering products, the user should be able to select 1 out of the 4 system categories. Once a user enters into a system subsection, they can expect to choose from a list of games to purchase. (Because a shopping cart is outside of the scope for this assignment, a simple form with mailto: function was implemented instead).
    D. Check Out - We left this option here so we can come back to this site to work on it further.

Requirements:
(1) An overview of our business can be found on both our home page as well as our "About Our Company" page. Our products page link to four different platforms (Nintendo, PlayStation, Windows, and XBox).
(2) Products are listed under their respective categories. The Nintendo page contains 6 products, the Playstation page contains 5 products, the XBox page contains 4 products, and the PC page contains 2 products. Each product has its own cell and multiple products in a page have their own rows and columns.
(3) Each product has a source image associated with it.
(4) Each product has a name and price associated with it. 
(5), (6), & (7) Clicking on any product will open up a form that contains both the product's description as well as information that the user can fill out. This includes a user's name, address, phone number, email, and preferred shipping option. Upon hitting "submit", an email client with all the purchase order information will pop-up. The user may choose to send email if they wish.
(8) Parameters for checking erronenous inputs have been coded so that the user may not, for example, enter letters into the Zip Code section. An alarm will be raised if bad data is submitted.
(9) Custom CSS for our website has been included in each page. There is a separate CSS document containing website style and formatting.
(10) The website has been checked for responsiveness as well as readibility for all types of devices and their respective resolutions.
(11) Mouse movement is tracked on the page so that when the user hovers over an image, the image's size is momentarily increased until the cursor is moved away from it.
