PA 1: Building a Dynamic Website

Our website features:
(1) Hamburger three bar menu - This feature allows for the navigation menu items to disappear into the hamburger icon. When clicking on the icon, the menu items appear in a slide-out style menu.
(2) There are 4 main pages
    A. Home - This page features an introductory greeting.
    B. About Our Company - This page contains detailed information regarding the two students who created the website.
    C. Products - Upon entering products, the user should be able to select 1 out of the 4 system categories. Once a user enters into a system subsection, they can expect to choose from a list of games to purchase. (Because a shopping cart is outside of the scope for this assignment, a simple form with mailto: function was implemented instead).
    D. Check Out - We left this option here so we can come back to this site to work on it further.
